00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,040
Excuse me. Can i get a comment, please?

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,560
Yes, ma'am, keep it right back here.

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,080
Stand back here, please.

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,250
- captain.
- agent lisbon.

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,330
Don't think we'll be needing you guys.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,400
We like the neighbor
kid who found the body.

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,910
Did he confess?

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,510
Ah, he's a real squirrel.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,960
Did you kill her?

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,680
Mercy's father would like
to give a brief statement.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,790
I just want to take a moment and thank everyone
in law enforcement and all the volunteers

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,700
Who helped us in the search
for our beloved daughter.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,930
The way that this entire community
has come together to support me

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,150
And juniper in this terrible time
has been a great comfort to us.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,210
And now i would just
like to ask you that...

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,400
You give us some time, space and
privacy to grieve for our daughter.

17
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,280
Thank you.

18
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,080
Hello, mrs. Tolliver.

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,040
Who are you?

20
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,560
My name is patrick jane.

21
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm here to help you.

22
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,320
Would you like a cup of tea?

23
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,670
Yes, i would, thank you.

24
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,660
You must be tired.

25
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,390
Why don't you sit down?

26
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,550
It's nice and quiet in here, isn't it?

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,430
Quiet, soothing, calm.

28
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,210
Calm.

29
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,530
I've been watching you and your husband,

30
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,720
And i want you to know that i
understand what you're feeling right now.

31
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,480
You have no idea.

32
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,260
- believe me.
- i do.

33
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,350
I know.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,950
I know, and i wanna help you.

35
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,500
You can't help me.
You... What do you know?

36
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,570
All sorts of things.

37
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,180
You really only pretend
to like skiing, right?

38
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,510
Yes,
but--

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,320
You're pleased that your best
friend recently gained some weight--

40
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,780
About 10 pounds.

41
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,490
You wish you'd been more
adventurous when you were younger.

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,550
You love india, but
you've never been there.

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,090
You have trouble sleeping.

44
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,960
Your favorite color...

45
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,070
Is blue.

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,620
I don't understand. You're...

47
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,320
- you're psychic?
- no.

48
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,070
Just paying attention.

49
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,010
I used to make a good living
pretending to be a psychic.

50
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,420
I tell you this because i want you to understand
there's no point hiding things from me.

51
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,930
Hiding... What?

52
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,170
Know what i see when
i look at your husband?

53
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,510
I see a warm, loving, generous man.

54
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,440
A little vain, maybe. Selfish,
controlling-- but a decent man.

55
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,410
Yes.

56
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,520
So why do you suspect him
of murdering your daughter?

57
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,490
I don't.

58
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,070
- the mccluskey boy did it.
- yes.

59
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,340
That's what the police say.

60
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,660
But you think they're wrong. Why?

61
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,370
I don't know. I-i-i
don't know. I...

62
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,450
Tell me.

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,280
Last year, they--they have
been so strange with each other.

64
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,360
And neither one would admit that
anything was wrong, and i think that...

65
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,350
I think that she tried to tell
me once, and i didn't--i...

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,290
God. Oh, god.

67
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,470
Did you ask him if he killed her?

68
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,590
What would he say?

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
Most wives can tell when
their husbands are lying.

70
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,690
Yes. Yes.

71
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,810
I... I don't want tea. I--
the mccluskey boy did it. I...

72
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,590
Maybe.

73
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,530
You think he did it, too?

74
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,630
I trust a mother's instinct.

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,350
June?

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,130
There you are.

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,000
Who are you?

78
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,930
I'm the police. Did
you kill your daughter?

79
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,170
How dare you?

80
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,050
I asked you a simple question,
sir. Did you kill your daughter?

81
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,710
No. I did not kill my daughter!

82
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,750
Now you get the hell out of my house!

83
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,790
June?

84
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,470
June, what's the matter with you?

85
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm gonna have your badge.

86
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,680
An innocent man would
have punched me by now.

87
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,170
I am gonna make life miserable for you.

88
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,780
You come in here, you accost
my wife, you cause trouble on--

89
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,680
June.

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,710
June, honey, please.

91
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,990
Move! Move!

92
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,580
Honestly, it--it's
not as bad as it looks.

93

Hot enough for you?

129
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,750
Which one of you jackasses told him?

130
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
It was you, wasn't it, cho?

131
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,420
Yes, it was.

132
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,510
Of course he called me.

133
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,820
It's red john. You can't
keep me out of this.

134
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,090
Why would you want to?

135
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,170
You got a man killed.
Ppthere's consequences.

136
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,670
Oh, a man that murdered his daughter 'cause
she wouldn't have sex with him anymore?

137
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,570
You didn't know that.
You did not know that.

138
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,830
- if she hadn't had left a
diary-- - but she did, though.

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,950
Be reasonable. This is my case.

140
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,170
Your case?

141
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,530
Red john's mine.

142
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,910
Red john doesn't belong to anyone.

143
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,040
He belongs to me.

144
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,040
It's not my call. Rules are rules.

145
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,280
Come back next week.

146

We haven't opened him
up yet, but burn marks...

150
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,210
Sorry i went over your head.

151
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,420
I'll redeem myself, i promise.

152
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,960
You want redemption? Be silent.

153
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,320
Okay. I can learn to do that.

154
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,080
Sorry.

155
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,320
The burn marks here indicate that the
victim was subdued with a stun gun--

156
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,800
Standard civilian
model by the look of it.

157
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,400
Death appears to be caused by several
blows to the back of the skull consistent

158
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,290
With a bloodied golf
club found at the scene.

T.o.d.looks to be
early saturday evening.

162
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,410
On alison, we have the
same stun gun marks,

163
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,470
Followed by binding with
tight black plastic ligatures,

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,770
Frenzied cutting and stabbing assault of the
torso and subsequent abuse of the viscera.

165
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,910
Textbook red john.

166
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,650
Who found the bodies?

167
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,890
This one's husband, coming home from the
airport sunday morning with his brother.

168
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,410
- he's a pro golfer.
- oh, yeah?

169
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,050
Price randolph.

170
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,950
What's her deal with him? Do we know?

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,920
Uh, he's on file as
one of her physicians.

172
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,750
- making a house call?
- lovers?

173
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,990
No, this one's gay.

174
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,130
Dr. Wagner might know what
their relationship was.

175
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,500
He's here to make the formal i.d.?

176
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,630
Okay.

177
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,030
Dr. Wagner.

178
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,050
I'm agent teresa lisbon,
california bureau of investigation.

179
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,690
What's your connection to the victims?

180
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,370
I work with gregory...

181
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,840
Dr. Tannen and--and the randolph family
are longtime clients of our practice.

182
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,920
Are house calls the
norm at your practice?

183
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,010
No. Gregory and alison
were close friends.

184
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,700
- lovers?
- no.

185
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,190
He was gay.

186
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,010
No, they were just... Friends.

187
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,130
What in god's name happened to them?

188
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,960
Looks like red john.

189
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,710
Who's red john?

190
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,820
We don't know who did this.

191
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,060
We'll be in touch probably. Thank you.

192
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,310
Set up right here?

193
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,630
Yeah, that's good.

194
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,790
Red john enters here.

195
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,170
Excuse me. Sorry.

196
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,410
He comes around here.

197
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,030
He waits for her, expecting
her to come in alone.

198
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,730
Only thing, her friend tannen chose the wrong night
to come over for a richard gere and ice cream orgy.

199
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,960
So red john zaps 'em both with
his trusty stun gun, and...

200
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,480
Excuse me.

201
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,060
Grabs a 5-iron from
the bag here and... Bam!

202
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,230
Crushes tannen's skull.

203
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Then he takes his sweet time
dealing with alison how he likes.

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,890
She's a nice big girl, so
unless he's pretty strong,

205
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,930
I'm guessing that he grabbed
her by the arms and...

206
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,500
{\a6}<i>Today is the.......</i>

207
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,980
He says he's sorry for all the pain
he's caused you and your mother.

208
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,530
{\a6}<i>5 Years Earlier</i>

209
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,570
Deeply sorry.

210
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,870
He asks you to forgive him.

211
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,810
Can you do that, jenny?

212
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,870
He needs to hear it.

213
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,120
I forgive you, daddy.

214
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,620
- oh, yes.
- daddy, i forgive you.

215
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,460
He's smiling now.

216
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,200
They're tears of joy.

217
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,440
He says, "god bless you and keep you."

218
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,440
He's gone.

219
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,860
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

220
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,190
She's... Amazed.

221
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,700
Patrick...

222
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,550
- one second.
- give him some time.

223
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,950
Ab-absolu-- come
on back to us.

224
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,260
- i'm back. Thank you.
- back.

225
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,520
So, patrick, i understand that you're
also sort of a paranormal detective.

226
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,870
Is that right?

227
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,220
I try to help the police when i can.

228
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,530
And--and you're helping them
hunt this scary serial killer.

229
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,790
- what--what's his name?Red
john? - red--red john.

230
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,590
Thar she blows-- classic
red john smiley face.

231
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,350
Drawn in the victims' blood, clockwise
with three fingers of his right hand,

232
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,820
Wearing a rubber kitchen glove.

233
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,330
I'm stoked to finally
see one in the flesh.

234
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,400
This isn't red john.

235
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,840
Right.

236
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,780
Red john thinks of himself
as a showman, an artist.

237
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,670
He has a strong sense of theater.

238
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,600
In all the previous killings,

239
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,680
He made sure that the first thing that
anyone sees is the face on the wall.

240
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,210
You see the face
first, and you know--

241
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,570
You know what's happened,
and you feel dread.

242
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,770
Then and only then do you
see the body of the victim--

243
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,330
Always in that order.

244
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,000
Here it's the opposite.

245
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:44,700
The first thing you see is the body, and you
have to look around to see the face on the wall.

246
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,950
Doesn't play nearly as well, does it?

247
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,010
Depends on your taste, i suppose.

248
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,260
No, come on. The killer could have
painted on the correct wall here,

249
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,460
But he didn't because he didn't know
better because he isn't red john.

250
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,000
It's interesting.

251
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,590
You know what your
problem is, my friend?

252
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,250
You enjoy your work a little too much.

253
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,520
You're a ghoul.

254
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,070
If you don't get horny reading
"fangoria," i'm britney spears.

255
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,590
I-i resent that.

256
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,780
This is you trying to
redeem yourself, is it?

257
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,970
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,360
He irks me.

259
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,620
He's irksome.

260
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,080
You don't need me here.

261
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,490
So, yeah, this one
doesn't fit the pattern.

262
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,060
So jane was right. We have a copycat.

263
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,150
Or we have red john trying new things,
or we have red john making a mistake.

264
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,020
We don't know.

265
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,710
We'll work the evidence
until we do know.

266
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,140
Go talk to the husband.

267
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,480
Will do, boss.

268
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,700
What are you waitin' for?

269
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,980
So you might be right about this
case. Might be. Thanks for the insight.

270
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,210
No. Did i say that?

271
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,660
I'm acknowledging the fact that
you might be right, that's all.

272
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,440
I mean, if you wanted to come
back, i couldn't stop you.

273
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,740
Yeah, fine. I'm asking you to come back.

274
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,320
Because.

275
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,280
Because you're useful to the team.

276
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,290
No. No, i won't say
"please." Go screw yourself.

277
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,510
Jackass.

278
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,610
- good morning.
- can i help you?

279
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,090
You must be van pelt.
Pleasure. Patrick jane.

280
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh, hi. Good to meet you.

281
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,380
Agent cho said you had left town.

282
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,420
No. Nowhere to go.

283
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,920
Okay.

284
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,020
Do you want that desk
over there or this one?

285
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,700
I mean, that one gets more light.

286
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,490
That one. More light by all means.

287
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,260
Very pleasant addition to
the serious crimes family.

288
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,060
When did you get here?

289
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,090
Stop. I give up.

290
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,220
- stop. Please, stop.
- hey, tag?

291
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,780
Turn off the camera.

292
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,830
- come on, come on, come on, that's enough.
- okay, we're done, we're done.

293
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,990
- you are just awful!
- okay. Go, go, go.

294
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,460
Stop, please. Stop!

295
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,560
I lost a beautiful, precious angel.

296
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,570
Yes, sir. Good-looking woman.

297
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm jumping right in if
you don't mind, price.

298
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,180
You missed the tournament
cut on friday, yes?

299
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,610
But you didn't come home until sunday.

300
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,000
What did you do with the
rest of your time in fresno?

301
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,120
I get this.you--you guys
can't catch the real killer,

302
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,050
So you wanna lay this one on me?

303
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,410
No, sir. If we have that
confirmation of where you were,

304
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,740
It lets us exclude you
from the investigation.

305
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,880
I was with a massage therapist.

306
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,730
Name?

307
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,980
It had "lady" in there somewhere.

308
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,860
It'll be on his credit card bill.

309
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,480
There you go.

310
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,790
Pleasure meeting you boys.

311
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,920
We're a full-service private practice.

312
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,990
We deliver primary care,
uh, cosmetic surgery,

313
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Psychotherapy, sports
medicine-- You name it.

314
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,910
What's the african connection?

315
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,630
It's what this place is all about.

316
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,200
Half our profits go to build and staff basic
health clinics in poor african communities.

317
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,860
Ah, here we are.

318
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,130
It's a thin file.

319
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,930
Alison was a healthy young woman.

320
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,650
Psychiatric history?

321
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,360
She didn't have one.

322
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,030
S.t.d.s? Abortions?
Unexplained injuries?

323
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,690
{\a6}<i>PERSONALITY AND DEMANGE</i>

324
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,420
No.

325
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,490
Except for some routine checkups with me,
it's all dr. Tannen-- All aesthetic work.

326
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,260
Did tannen keep a diary?

327
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Our last case was solved
because the victim kept a diary.

328
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,070
Diary? I don't think so.

329
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,900
Getting back to alison randolph...

330
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,430
How was her marriage, do you think?

331
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,930
Happy? Unhappy?

332
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,290
About six months ago, dr.
Tannen asked my advice.

333
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,090
Alison had asked him to get her a year's
supply of birth control pills off the books,

334
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,290
Which is strictly against a.m.a.code.

335
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,120
I said sure, do it.

336
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,740
I mean, better us than
some tijuana drugstore.

337
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,950
Why the secrecy?

338
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,700
Price randolph had a
vasectomy, april of '02.

339
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,390
If there's anything else i can do...

340
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,630
I appreciate that.

341
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,750
Actually, there is.

342
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm out of sleeping pills.

343
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,360
Can you fix me up?

344
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,860
Anything strong will do.

345
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,880
Sure. Uh, come in for a consultation.

346
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,600
We'll squeeze you in this afternoon.

347
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,200
Oh, no. I-i was hoping
to get something now.

348
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,910
Trying to avoid the chitchat.

349
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,240
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,070
I wouldn't feel comfortable prescribing
without some sort of "chitchat."

351
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,880
I understand. Uh, no problem.

352
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,470
I'll call you... Maybe.

353
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,710
I like the husband for it.

354
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,040
He hires some hooker he knows
to create an alibi, flies home,

355
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,090
Fillets the spouse, flies back again.

356
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,490
The classic elaborate and clever
but ultimately stupid plan.

357
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,510
Have you looked at his
pga tournament record?

358
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,380
It's not bad. 6 mil career earnings.

359
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,670
Mm-hmm, for coming in second and third.

360
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,210
You put him on the 18th tee
with a big one on the line,

361
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,400
Like night follows day, he'll shank it.

362
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,880
He's a choker.

363
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,290
He doesn't have the nerve to
kill his wife. Didn't do it.

364
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,970
Are you suggesting we drop a prime
suspect because he's never won a major?

365
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,740
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just
making idle conversation.

366
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,870
How'd you do that?

367
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,470
Telekinesis.

368
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
He blew on it.

369
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,110
That is another way to do it.

370
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,680
Mr. Jane, i have a question
regarding your previous career path.

371
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,200
Fire away.

372
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,270
When you met with other
psychics-- real psychics--

373
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,920
Could they tell you
were just pretending?

374
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,100
There's no such thing as real psychics.

375
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,300
I beg to differ.

376
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,120
My cousin yolanda is a psychic.

377
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,080
Your cousin is deluded
or dishonest, or both.

378
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,160
Steady.

379
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,780
No, no, he's entitled to his opinion.

380
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,250
He's wrong, though.

381
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,010
- she has power.
- thank you.

382
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,120
She can communicate with the other side.

383
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,610
I've seen her do it myself.

384
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,790
She let you speak with
someone that's gone.

385
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,660
Yes.

386
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,780
Someone that you love
and still miss very much.

387
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,080
Yes.

388
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,390
You wanted her power
to be real, so it was.

389
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,710
No.

390
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,540
You're so sure you're right.

391
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,640
Science don't know everything.

392
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,110
500 years ago, radio
would've seemed like magic.

393
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,140
Exactly.

394
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,440
500 years in the future, it could be totally
normal to communicate with the other side.

395
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,600
The "other side."

396
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,230
Your father's a football coach, yeah?

397
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,010
How'd you know that?

398
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,800
It's obvious from your whole demeanor.

399
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,040
My point is, didn't dad always
say life is like football?

400
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,810
When that final whistle
blows, the game is over. Done.

401
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,670
There is no more. There
is no "other side."

402
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,550
This is it-- lobster and bread
rolls and nautical kitsch.

403
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,040
And then... Nothingness.

404
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,610
You poor, sad man.

405
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,800
The kingdom of god is a real place.

406
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,650
Okay, later tonight, when rigsby asks
you to come back to his hotel room...

407
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,100
Say yes.

408
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,990
Excuse me?

409
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,970
I know. You were planning
on refusing him very curtly.

410
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,980
First week on the job,
you wanna set a tone.

411
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,960
No monkey business. But why not?

412
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,940
Rigsby is an excellent lover, i'm sure.

413
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,910
Tough but fair. Right?

414
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,460
Right.

415
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,770
The kingdom of god is a real place,
mr. Jane, and you have an immortal soul.

416
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,660
Oh, i do so hope you're wrong.

417
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,130
Good night.

418
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140
- good night.
- later, dude.

419
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,930
This is... Me.

420
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,410
Welcome to the unit, agent van pelt.

421
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,110
Thank you, agent rigsby.

422
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:18,260
She explodes into action,
reaching up to 60 miles per hour.

423
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,900
She easily outruns her terrifying prey.

424
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,620
Gs, old friend.

425
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,060
It's been a while.

426
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,540
"i hope you are keeping well.

427
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,300
I am thriving and happy.

428
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,090
I HAVE 12 WIVES NOW AND WILL
SOON BEGIN COURTING NUMBER 13."

429
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,380
"why can't you catch me?"

430
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,950
YOU MUST FEEL SO POWERLESS
AND STUPID AND SAD."

431
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,370
"oh, well.ALL THE BEST. Red john."

432
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,370
That sounds like the real deal to me.

433
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,600
Sounds like red john. It's not.

434
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,170
Red john wouldn't risk
capture just to taunt me.

435
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,630
So the real killer's
trying to throw us offtrack?

436
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,610
Cho, find out where price
randolph was a half an hour ago.

437
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,060
Rigsby, i want you to check
the hotel security cameras.

438
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,230
Get those over to forensics.

439
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,820
You okay?

440
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,960
Absolutely.

441
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,940
Get some sleep.

442
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,770
- hello?
- good morning.

443
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,770
You didn't sleep, did you?

444
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,100
I-i'd like to make an appointment
with dr. Wagner, please. It's urgent.

445
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,600
Jane. Patrick jane. Yeah, i'll hold.

446
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,200
Forensics maybe got a break.

447
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,860
The blood on the cloth in the
envelope is alison randolph's.

448
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,450
But they found a hair in there--
doesn't belong to her or tannen.

449
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,180
Guess who it does belong to.

450
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,100
It's yours, tag. Amazing, huh?

451
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,080
Science.

452
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,170
This is insane.

453
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,730
I didn't... I didn't kill alison.

454
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,900
How do you explain your
hair in the envelope?

455
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,110
Either it was a mistake,
or--or i'm being framed.

456
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,370
Who would want to frame you?

457
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,370
We don't want to, if
that's what you're thinking.

458
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,610
He and alison were lovers.

459
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,280
Who would want to frame you, tag?

460
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,420
My brother.

461
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,730
Why would he want to do that?

462
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,410
Alison and i were lovers.

463
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,970
I think you are psychic.
You're just afraid to admit it.

464
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,120
So...

465
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,120
So...

466
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,240
Why is it you can't sleep?

467
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,470
Because i can't get the good
pills without talking to a doctor.

468
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,740
And you don't like talking to doctors.

469
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,380
Meh, you know, they always wanna be the
smartest person in the room, don't they?

470
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,870
When in fact that's me, obviously.

471
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,220
You protect your core
self very fiercely.

472
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,720
What do you think is
the reason for that?

473
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,100
You know, this is exactly
how i imagined it would be.

474
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,010
You gonna ask me about my mother?

475
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,650
Do you want me to ask
you about your mother?

476
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,310
I just wanna sleep.

477
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,100
So what is it that keeps you awake?

478
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,880
What's his name? Red john?

479
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,090
That's right. Red john.

480
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,410
Uh, he's--he's killed at least
eight women that we know of.

481
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,040
Uh, the police asked me to try
and get a psychic fix on him,

482
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,050
To see if i could get a
sense of who this man is.

483
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,780
Uh, how do you do that exactly,
get a psychic fix on someone?

484
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,340
Well, davis, true demonic
evil burns like fire.

485
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,290
It--it burns with a
terrible cold, dark flame.

486
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:17,990
I force myself to look into that flame,
and i see an image of the evildoer--

487
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,900
In this case, red john.

488
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,540
He's an ugly, tormented little man.

489
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,440
A lonely soul.

490
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,090
Sad, very sad.

491
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,750
"dear mr. Jane, i do not like
to be slandered in the media,

492
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,130
Especially by a dirty
money-grubbing fraud."

493
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,740
"IF YOU ARE A REAL PSYCHIC INSTEAD
OF A DISHONEST LITTLE WORM,"

494
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,790
"YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SEE
WHAT I'VE DONE TO YOUR LOVELY WIFE AND CHILD."

495
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,320
Mr. Jane? Mr. Jane?

496
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,830
What is it that keeps you awake?

497
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,370
You know, when i was
a boy, we had a farm.

498
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,240
It's a lot of work.

499
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,550
- i was kind of a lazy kid.
- yes?

500
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:48,530
I'd always be trying to get my little
brother jimmy to do my chores for me.

501
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,360
One day, i promised him a
dollar if he'd cut the firewood.

502
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,050
Well...

503
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,510
He opened up an artery in his leg
on the saw, and he bled to death...

504
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,560
Died...

505
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,320
Doing my chores for me.

506
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,600
You know...

507
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:23,500
That's almost exactly the same
thing that happened to johnny cash.

508
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,420
Is it really?

509
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,750
That's spooky.

510
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,110
- mr. Randolph,
good-- - cut the crap.

511
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,140
My brother's done nothing.

512
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,710
And you scumbags haven't got the stones to
come after me, so you come after my family.

513
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,280
- that is flat-out persecution.
- price, what did we agree?

514
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,860
Mr. Randolph, rest assured,
there's no intent to persecute you.

515
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,200
We scumbags are holding your brother

516
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,480
Because we have physical evidence linking
him to the crime and potential motive in that

517
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,690
He states that whenever you weren't around,
he was banging your wife like a big bass drum.

518
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,060
Tag and alison?

519
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,260
That's what he states, And he further
states that it was you that killed alison,

520
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,770
- and you're now trying to frame him in revenge.
- what'd you say?

521
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,160
Wh--bastard!
You--

522
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,260
- son of a bitch!
- you treated her like trash!

523
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,360
What did you expect?

524
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,040
I didn't expect my little
brother to be banging my wife!

525
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,510
You little punk bastard!

526
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,260
Everything you've told me
is total fiction, isn't it?

527
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,130
Yes.

528
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,090
Why?

529
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,530
I can tell you're in real pain.

530
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,250
Why not tell the truth?

531
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,970
The truth is mine.

532
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,660
- i hear ya.
- thank you.

533
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

534
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,840
Remember, uh, we were talking
about tannen the other day,

535
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,050
And i asked you if he kept
a diary, and you said he did?

536
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,560
- well, there's no diary among his effects.
- no.

537
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,220
I'm sorry, no?

538
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,000
No. You have it wrong. I-i
didn't think he kept a diary.

539
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,860
Strange.

540
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,110
Then it must have been
someone else who told me.

541
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,860
Either that or i'm going mad.

542
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,790
But i definitely, 100% remember
hearing that tannen kept a diary.

543
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,430
Well, that is strange, but why
does it matter if he kept a diary?

544
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,630
You're right. It doesn't matter.

545
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,440
Only i was thinking, why do magicians
have beautiful girl assistants?

546
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,100
Why?

547
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,890
Because they're reliable
distracters of attention.

548
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,120
People will look at a
beautiful girl for a long time

549
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,960
Before they look where they should be looking
if they wanna see how the trick really works.

550
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,600
Anyhow, i'll send over a couple of forensics guys
tomorrow to search his office and locate that diary.

551
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,510
Mm, didn't they already
search his office?

552
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,830
Oh, they never do it
thoroughly the first time.

553
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,380
Once more for luck, eh? It's
gotta be there somewhere.

554
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,290
Thanks for everything, doc.

555
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,850
- good night.
- good night.

556
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,820
Lost something?

557
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,410
How did you get in?

558
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,500
Door was open.

559
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,660
I think i left my phone in your office.

560
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,130
The door wasn't open.

561
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,670
Must have been. Here i am.

562
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,910
What are you doing?

563
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,980
I confess, the temptation to play
detective was a little too strong. I...

564
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,550
I was looking for that diary.

565
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,070
I got a little carried away.

566
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,180
No kidding.

567
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,200
No diary?

568
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,630
No diary.

569
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,460
Maybe i should have a gander.

570
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,790
I'm good at finding things.

571
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Be my guest.

572
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,170
Eureka.

573
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,670
Dr. Wagner, thanks for your help.

574
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,940
Mr. Jane.

575
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,940
Uh, your phone.

576
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,750
Right.

577
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,800
Thanks.

578
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,780
Uh, yeah. Got it.

579
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,330
Silly of me.

580
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,380
- well, good-bye
again. - wait.

581
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,490
Give me the diary.

582
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,870
It's very amusing.

583
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,710
I try.

584
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,820
I knew.

585
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,650
I knew it might be a trick, but i...

586
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,770
I had to be sure.

587
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,250
Yes. That's how the trick works.

588
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,050
What led you to me?

589
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,100
Not that i'm saying i
did it. I'm just asking.

590
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,060
When we first met, you said you
didn't know who red john was,

591
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,090
But you have books on
criminal psychiatry--there--

592
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,310
That have chapters on him.

593
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:21,000
You're the randolph family doctor, so you
could easily get a strand of tag's hair,

594
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:28,280
And, being a doctor, you could hack
up another human without difficulty.

595
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,240
It's obvious it was you.

596
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,290
That's it?

597
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,570
You have nothing.

598
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,910
That's just guesswork.

599
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,670
Oh, i know.

600
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,860
I just wanted to be sure
i had the right answer.

601
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,730
I was surprised. I gotta be honest.

602
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,880
You don't seem to be a wicked man.

603
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But you are.

604
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,340
You're angry about the letter.

605
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,370
Yeah, it was a bit mean-spirited.

606
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,850
For the record, i'm
sorry about your family.

607
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,930
I can only imagine your pain.

608
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,390
I'm not... A wicked man.

609
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,870
My conscience is clear.

610
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,310
Really?

611
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,790
Right now in africa, there's 3,000
beautiful children alive today

612
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,500
Who should be dead, but
they aren't because of me.

613
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:32,020
Tannen was gonna ruin me
and destroy all that work...

614
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,450
Over nothing. Money.

615
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,670
Theft, he called it.

616
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,230
Embezzlement.

617
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,090
Self-righteous idiot.

618
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,500
It's simple math.

619
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,530
If i go to jail,
thousands of kids will die.

620
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,640
So i made a rational, moral
decision to kill tannen...

621
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,220
For the greater good.

622
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,870
And alison? What did she do wrong?

623
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,710
As you said, she was the magician's
assistant, just a distraction.

624
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,740
If only tannen died, the police would've
been all over this place, wouldn't they?

625
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:19,520
Truly, is killing two any worse than
killing one, when so many lives are at stake?

626
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,680
I don't think so.

627
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,960
You poor, sad man. You're under arrest.

628
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,770
- let's go.
- i'm pointing a gun at you.

629
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,420
You really think i would set you up so
nicely and let you pull a loaded gun on me?

630
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,480
I took the bullets out earlier.

631
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,700
- you're late!
- what?

632
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,530
Draw your weapon!

633
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,930
Drop the gun!

634
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,720
Hands on your head.

635
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,390
Get down on your knees. Down.

636
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,300
Closed case doughnuts are here.

637
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,950
I just went to get sleeping
pills, i swear to god.

638
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,670
I-i didn't even wanna go.

639
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,810

- right.

640
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,440
Yeah, you didn't set wagner up...

641
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,300
Didn't figure it was him days ago.

642
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,470
You didn't let us tear apart the victim's family
simply to satisfy your childish need for drama.

643
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,290
Meh, that family was screwed anyway.

644
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,890
Don't blame yourselves, guys.

645
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,780
Don't even start.

646
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,790
I'm still angry.

647
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,220
- i'm sorry.
- no, you're not.

648
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,430
A frog? Well, this makes
everything better, doesn't it?
